# K-nearest-neighbour-from-scratch

This program is a rewrite, converting a MATLAB project into a python project.
This project works by:
. Dynamically sorts N clusters to their closest centroid.
. Plots all the clusters along with their centroids on a scatter graph.
. Repeats cluster assigning with increasing cluster amounts up to K amount.
. Total distance for each cluster amount appended to list, creating a plot showing each cluster amount and its WSS (With-in-Sum-of-Squares).
